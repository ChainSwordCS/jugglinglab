Generator_intro = This is the siteswap generator component of Juggling Lab, derived from the\n\
   program J2 v2.3, written by Jack Boyce in Feb 1992. It finds juggling patterns\n\
   in a generalized form of siteswap notation. For a full description of this\n\
   notation and the program's operation, consult the documentation at\n\
   https://jugglinglab.org. All patterns satisfying the given constraints are\n\
   listed by the program. Solo asynchronous juggling is the default mode.\n\n\
   Usage:   gen <number> <max throw> <period> [-options]\n\n\
   where options include:\n  \
    -n             show number of patterns\n  \
    -no            print number only\n  \
    -se            hide starting/ending sequences for excited state patterns\n\n  \
    -x <regex> ..  exclude listed regular expressions\n  \
    -i <regex> ..  must include listed regular expressions\n  \
    -lame          remove '11' sequence in async mode\n\n  \
    -g             ground state patterns only\n  \
    -ng            excited state patterns only\n  \
    -f             full listing (including composite patterns)\n  \
    -prime         prime patterns only\n  \
    -rot           show all rotated versions of patterns (e.g., 645 and 564)\n\n  \
    -m <number>    multiplexing with at most <number> simultaneous throws\n  \
    -mf            allow simultaneous nontrivial catches (squeeze patterns)\n  \
    -mc            disallow multiplex clustered throws (e.g., [33])\n  \
    -mt            require at least one multiplexed throw with no holds\n\n  \
    -s             find synchronous siteswaps\n\n  \
    -j <number>    set number of jugglers\n  \
    -cp            show only connected passing patterns\n  \
    -d <number>    passing communication delay (see docs)\n  \
    -l <number>    passing leader person number (for use with -d)\n  \
    -jp            show patterns with all juggler permutations\n\n\
   Examples:\n  \
   gen 5 7 5\n  \
   gen 5 7 5 -x 2 3\n  \
   gen 5 7 18 -prime\n  \
   gen 4 6 6 -s -g\n  \
   gen 5 6 4 -m 2 -g -mt\n  \
   gen 6 4 2 -j 2 -g -jp -m 2 -d 1 -l 1
CLI_help1 = This is the command line interface to Juggling Lab. Recognized options:\n\n   \
   jlab start\n\n      \
      Launches the application.\n\n   \
   jlab anim <pattern> [<prefs>]\n\n      \
      Opens a window with an animation of the given pattern, using the\n      \
      given (optional) animation preferences.\n\n   \
   jlab gen <gen_options> [-out <path>]\n\n      \
      Runs the siteswap generator and prints a list of patterns, using the\n      \
      given set of generator options to define the number of objects, etc.\n      \
      Type "jlab gen" with no options for a help message. The output may\n      \
      optionally be written to a file.\n\n   \
   jlab togif <pattern> [<prefs>] -out <path>\n\n      \
      Saves a pattern animation to a file as an animated GIF, using the\n      \
      given (optional) animation preferences.\n\n   \
   jlab tojml <pattern> [-out <path>]\n\n      \
      Converts a pattern to JML notation, Juggling Lab's internal XML-based\n      \
      pattern description. This may optionally be written to a file.\n\n\
Pattern input:\n\n   \
   <pattern> can take one of three formats:\n\n   \
   1. A pattern in siteswap notation, for example 771 or (6x,4)(4,6x).\n   \
   2. A siteswap pattern annotated with additional settings, in a semi-\n      \
      colon separated format. This is described in more detail at\n      \
      https://jugglinglab.org/html/sspanel.html\n   \
   3. A JML pattern read in from a file, using the format '-jml <path>'.\n\n\
Animation preferences input:\n\n   \
   <prefs> are optional wherever they are used, and are used to override\n   \
   Juggling Lab's default preferences. These are given in a semicolon-\n   \
   separated format. See https://jugglinglab.org/html/animinfo.html\n\n\
NOTE: These settings may contain characters that are interpreted in special\n\
ways by command line interpreters. On Windows use double quotes around\n\
settings to avoid confusion, and single quotes on Mac OS X/Unix.\n\n
CLI_help2 = Examples:\n\n   \
      jlab anim '(6x,4)*'\n   \
      jlab togif 'pattern=3;dwell=1.0;bps=4.0;hands=(-30)(2.5).(30)(-2.5).(-30)(0).' -out mills.gif\n   \
      jlab anim -jml my_favorite_pattern.jml\n   \
      jlab anim 771 -prefs 'stereo=true;width=800;height=600'\n   \
      jlab anim 5B -prefs 'bouncesound=true'\n   \
      jlab gen 5 7 5\n
